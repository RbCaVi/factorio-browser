This means if you use a lot of mods it is more likely one may be marked as incompatible later due to an issue you had not yet discovered. You are of course free to edit your info.json file to try incompatible mods but you do so at your own risk: if your game state becomes unplayable because of it I won't be able to help you.\\n\\nThere is some additional information relating to mod compatibility on the Space Exploration wiki.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Recommended mods[/color][/font]\\n \u2022 Module Inserter. Allows you to put modules in machines from satellite view.\\n \u2022 Grappling Gun. Allows you to jump over buildings, across lakes, and out of combat if you get slowed. In space you can get back to space platform if you fall off. Also lets you board spaceships (especially useful if they are moving).\\n \u2022 Inserter Fuel Leech. This is just for the AAI burner phase, it lets burner inserters fuel themselves from the entity they are collecting from.\\n \u2022 Text Plates Allows you to put text on the ground, useful for marking planet names, station names, spaceship docking zones, etc.\\n \u2022 Combat Mechanics Overhaul. Can help with defences when off planet if you enable the \"Walls Block Spitters\" option. It is cheaper to repair walls than turrets. \\n \u2022 Bullet Trails. Faint lines follow your bullets so you can see where they are going, or what gun turrets are shooting at. (Also looks better.)\\n \u2022 Milestones.

It is NOT recommended to play with other overhaul mods as they tend to break a lot of the per-planet resource balance, item logistics, building patterns, and general game progression. If it is your first time playing Space Exploration you should avoid other overhaul mods otherwise you won't know what has been broken.\\n\\n Most other overhaul mods are marked as incompatible if the tech tree is significantly broken. The long term intention is to add compatibility with a select few overhaul mods making sure that the main mechanics and features of both are preserved to the satisfaction of both mod developers.\\n Krastorio 2 is an example of this work already substantially underway.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Recommended settings[/color][/font]\\nYou MUST have all alien biomes terrain tiles enabled, otherwise the game will crash at a later point.\\n\\nAs the game is longer than normal, it is a good idea to start a game with low enemy evolution factors.\\n\\nYou should not set high resources settings for your starting planet unless you are playing with resource intensive recipes, such as high difficulty recipes or marathon mode. If resources are set too high it will reduce the need to expand to other planets.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Helpful urls[/color][/font]\\nTake a look at the Space Exploration Wiki over here: [color=blue]https://spaceexploration.miraheze.org[/color]\\nGet help or follow the development on Discord: [color=blue]https://discord.gg/ymjUVMv[/color]\\n\\nI've put over 4000 hours into this mod.

They fire in sequence, so later defences won't all fire if all the meteors were destroyed. Defences require ammo, charge time, and additional power while charging.

Every planet and moon has a specific type of core that determines the type of core seams they have, and the core seam determines the type of core fragment they yield. For example, a planet with a copper core will have copper core seams that give copper core fragments. The starting planet gives a balance of common resources but other places tend to mainly give 1 resource type.\\n\\nThe first core miner placed on a planet runs at 100% efficiency, but each additional miner placed reduces the efficency of all the others on the same planet. Placing additional miners always increases the total core fragment output overall. To get 2x total output you need 2x2=4 miners, 3x output needs 3x3=9 miners, 10x output needs 10x10=100 miners. There are only so many core seams per planet with smaller planets having fewer suitable mining spots. Core mining on smaller planet/moons is slower over all, however the weaker gravity well makes it easier to get the resources off the surface.\\n\\nIn the early game it can be useful to have 1 core miner running when you have excess power. If you start on a tiny planet or islands then solar power plus core mining might be your only way to get enough resources to get off the planet.\\n\\nLate game core miners benefit greatly from mining productivity bonuses.

The change also allows and promotes a wider range of factory designs.\\n\\nThe Basic Beacon is individually much more powerful than a vanilla beacon, but cannot stack their effects on one machine so the maximum boost you can provide is reduced compared to vanilla. The more powerful beacons are able to far exceed the maximum boost on a machine available in Vanilla.\\n\\nStarting from Wide Area Beacon players can experience substantial amount in module savings as well as freedom to create complex design revolving around larger buildings or with multiple fluid or material inputs.\\n\\nMachines affected by more than one beacon will be marked with a Beacon Overload icon and pause all production. They will still continue to consume minimal power in the process.\\n\\nThe different beacon types are useful for different reasons. Basic beacons have a very low power draw so are useful for power-efficient builds. Wide area beacons have a huge area so are the most module-efficient option if you can affect many machines.

The cargo rocket sections used cannot be recovered.\\n\\nTravelling in space: You can travel between adjacent space zones, such as from planet orbit to the closest moon orbit, between moon orbits, or from outer moon orbits to an asteroid belt. While you can travel in interstellar space the available destinations are not reliable. Travelling from orbit to the planet or moon surface below is easier and does not have a capacity limit.\\n\\nReentry: The space capsule can land on a planet or moon for a small rocket fuel cost.

The steam produced by the Electric boiler contains less energy than the electricity used to turn the water to steam, so it is not useful for normal power production and can't be used for an infinite energy loop. Instead the steam can be stored in storage tanks, saving the energy so that it can be used in energy production later. This can offer higher capacity energy storage than accumulators of the same cost, but is less energy efficient than accumulators.

In these locations using steam power with Steam turbines may seem futile, since the constant stream of water required by Steam turbines could not all be supplied from off world sources. In these cases Condenser turbines come in incredibly handy. Condenser turbines act just like a normal Steam turbine with one key difference: rather than exhausting the incoming steam into the atmosphere, the steam is condensed back down into water and output from the turbine. This lets Condenser turbines be used in a (mostly) closed loop where only small amounts of water are required to top off the system. Do note that Condenser turbines are a little less power efficient than Steam turbines, meaning that you will get slightly less power out of the same amount of heat when run through Condenser turbines instead of Steam turbines; this is the tradeoff for recovering the water.\\n\\n[img=item/se-big-turbine] [font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]High Temperature Steam[/color][/font]\\nAt a certain point, using steam to create vast amounts of power starts to become unwieldy due to the number of Steam turbines required. To circumvent this scaling problem, high temperature steam may be used as a replacement. Produced by High temperature heat exchangers, and consumed by High temperature turbine generators, high temperature steam is incredibly energy dense. It can be used to dramatically shrink the size of steam power production. In order to use High temperature heat exchangers, a source of heat is required. Nuclear reactors cannot get hot enough to work with High temperature heat exchangers. Instead either an Energy beam receiver or an Antimatter reactor must be used as the heat source. Standard Heat pipes are not capable of transfering high temperature heat; only Naquium heat pipes are capable of transfering high temperature heat.

Container stress based on the item and fluid storage capacity of the ship.\\n\\nThe total integrity stress is whichever stress factor is larger, the two values are not added together. If your structural stress is 250 and your container stress is 280, the integrity stress will be 280.\\n\\nThe Hull stress bar shows 3 values. The first is the current discounted hull stress based on empty spaceship tiles. Up to 10% of a ship's size does not count towards integrity stress if it is empty spaceship tiles. This clear space is discounted in the stress calculation and is useful for corridors. The second value is the hull stress with no discount and is useful to estimate the ship stress value you would have if you fill the interior with structures. The third value is the max stress your tech level will allow.\\n\\nExceptionally long thin ships, or ships with very thin sections in the middle are less sturdy than more rotund designs.

You can manually trigger an integrity check to see how the streamlining is going.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Speed[/color][/font]\\nShip speed is based on the thrust of the engines vs the ship weight (approximated by integrity stress).

Engines at the edge of the ship also have a slight advantage.\\n\\nYou can set a target speed for the ship to aim for.

This is to prevent blueprinted spaceships from accidentally launching while still in the middle of being built by bots.\\n\\nNote: The console only checks for changes to the input signal every second; a sustained signal is required for the ship to react, single tick pulses will not work.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Circuit Signal Passthrough[/color][/font]\\nSpaceship clamps have a power and circuit network connection point in their upper corner. When clamps are connected during automatic landing, the power and circuit network signals are joined, allowing for power and circuit signals to be passed between the ship and the landing location.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Automatic Landing[/color][/font]\\nTo cause a spaceship to land, the console must be given a pair of anchor signals, either:\\n\"anchor using left clamp\" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp]) with \"anchor to right clamp\" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp])\\n\"anchor using right clamp\" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp]) with \"anchor to left clamp\" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-left-clamp])\\n\\nThe value of the \"anchor using ...\" signal must match the value of a clamp on the ship.\\nThe value of the \"anchor to ...\" signal must match the value of a clamp at the destination.\\nYou can see and change these values on clamps by opening a clamp's UI. If a match is found for both the \"anchor using ...\" and \"anchor to ...\" signals given to the ship console, then the ship will try to land with the two clamps connected. Use with caution.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Clamps[/color][/font]\\nTo set the ID of a clamp, open the clamp GUI and change the numeric value of the clamp signal to the ID you wish for the clamp to have. You never need to change the type of the clamp signal.\\n\\nYou can disable an anchored clamp by passing it a red signal.\\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Landing Example[/color][/font]\\nThe spaceship has a left-clamp with ID 315. In that clamp's GUI the signal is [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] with a value of 315.\\nThe landing surface has a right-clamp with ID 147. In that clamp's GUI the signal is [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp] with a value of 147.\\nIn order to get the spaceship to land using those two clamps, the left side of the ship console must be passed the following signals:\\n[img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] 315\\n[img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp] 147", "space-exploration.menu_arcospheres": "[img=item/se-arcosphere-a] Arcospheres", "space-exploration.title_arcospheres": "Arcospheres", "space-exploration.page_arcospheres_text_1": "Arcospheres are near perfect spheres of nano-engineered naquium crystal.

The spheres can be polarised so that they can manipulate certain aspects of space time if moved relative to one another. Sets of specific arcospheres can be used to warp and weave spacetime into higher dimensions. \\n\\n[font=heading-2][color=#ffe6c0]Usage[/color][/font]\\nArcospheres are the most unique production challenge in the game. They are used as tools in recipes but are never destroyed, they are only altered. The main challenge in their use is cycling through the spheres you have so you don\u2019t end up running out of a specific type.
